Tian, the project you propose poses to serious problems: 
1) the data... it looks like you will be creating your own dataset, and that
   could be a problem because of time constraints and because it is difficult
   to do.
2) project is too hard... once you have data, the project is quite complicated
   and you may not have enough time to finish.

I recommend you to think of something else and let me know. Think of a kaggle
dataset or UCI dataset. However, you could ignore my advise and go for it if
you already have data and if you already have some experience on this.

Go for it.
