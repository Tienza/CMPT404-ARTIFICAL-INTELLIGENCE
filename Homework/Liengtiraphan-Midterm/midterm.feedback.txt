Tien,

Here is your feedback and grade breakdown by problems:

1) The experiments seem ok, except that you may not have given the perceptron
enough time to make progress after the linear regression starting point. What
if 2500 wasn't enough? -1pt
You did not report E_out -5pts

2) It seems like the code works only for initially small values of N. What if I
over-estimate N and start with N=1,000,000? Your code would not work. -1pt
Why is your code not commented? -2pts

3) No picture/drawing, just a text file generated base on my picture :( +1pt


Peace,
